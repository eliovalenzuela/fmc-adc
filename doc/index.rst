Welcome to FMC ADC 100M 14 bit 4 Channel's documentation!
=========================================================
This is the user manual of the driver for the `FMC ADC 100M 14b 4cha`_
board developed on the `Open Hardware Repository`_. FMC is the form
factor of the card, ADC is its role, 100M means it can acquire
100Msample per second, 14b is the numbers of meaningful bits and 4cha
states it has 4 input channels (plus a trigger input).


The project has been splitted in sub-projects, one for each development
domain: `hardware`_, `gateware`_ and `software`_.
