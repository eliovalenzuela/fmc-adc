 * fmcadc_op: it describes the set of operation that a device library should
 * 	      support
 *
 * @start_acquisition start the acquisition
 *	@dev: device where to start acquiring
 *	@flags:
 *	@timeout: it can be used to specify how much time wait that acquisition
 *		  is over. This value follow the select() policy: NULL to wait
 *		  until acquisition is over; {0, 0} to return immediately
 *		  without wait; {x, y} to wait acquisition end for a specified
 *		  time
 *
 * @stop_acquisition stop the acquisition
 *	@dev: device where to stop acquisition
 *	@flags:
 *
 * @apply_config specific operation to apply a configuration to the device
 *	@dev: device to configure
 *	@flags:
 *	@conf: configuration to apply on device.
 *
 * @retrieve_config specific board operation to get the current configuration
 *		    of the device
 *	@dev: device where retireve configuration
 *	@flags:
 *	@conf: configuration to retrieve. The mask tell which value acquire,
 *	       then the library will acquire and set the value in the "value"
 *	       array
 *
 * @request_buffer get from the device a buffer
 * 	@dev: device where look for a buffer
 * 	@buf: where store the buffer. The user must allocate this structure.
 *	@flags:
 *	@timeout: it can be used to specify how much time wait that a buffer is
 *		  ready. This value follow the select() policy: NULL to wait
 *		  until acquisition is over; {0, 0} to return immediately
 *		  without wait; {x, y} to wait acquisition end for a specified
 *		  time
 *
 * @release_buffer release the resources of a given buffer
 *	@dev: device that generate the buffer
 *	@buf: buffer to release
